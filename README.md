## Highlights from Dashboard
Categories like Electronics, Computer and Accessories and Home and Kitchen dominate in generating revenue above others, based on the high review count and ratings on products like Boat, AmazonsBasics. Most products were found to be on the affordable side based on the price bucket range, with more discounts on Home and Health products. There was an understable complex relatonship between discounts and rating because for the fact that a product has a discount doesn't mean it will be highly rated.

## Tools and Skills Used

All analysis was done using Microsoft excel

## Data Cleaning and Aggregation

- Blanks were removed, corrected data inconsistencies, trimmed data, moved on to used pivot table to point out precise insights during analysis

## Excel Formulars

- Calculated columns was used expressly and formulars like IF, SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT came in handy

## Visualization
- Through the creation of intuitive charts and figures e.g Bar chart, pie chart, line chart, Histogram etc.

## Slicers

- This allowed easy sorting and filtering through the data which made the dashboard interactive

## Insights 

- Conclusions became seamless based on the easy comprehsion of trends in the data

## Recommendations

Focus marketing on the highly rated categories because they are the most reviwed in terms of Rating Count. Just because prices are discounted doesn't mean it will do well, as many products still received poor rating, hence focus also on Customer Satisfaction.

There were cases of productd that drove serious engagement, like the Electronics Category, promoting this high-end products will definitely increase revenue. Also products with high reviews but mid ratings can improve from feedback campaigns and quality assurance.

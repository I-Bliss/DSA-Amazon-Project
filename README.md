# DSA-Amazon-Project
A structured and detailed Microsoft Excel based analytical project on the brand that is known for a wide range of products and service; Amazon. Designed during my time with DSA Incubator with indepth understanding of Amazon's product reviews and rating, distribution, discounts as well as pricing. this project provided valuable insights into customer engagements, product performance, trends with categories of products and revenue which came to play after using calculated fields, pivot tables,   and an interactive dashboard.
